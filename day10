HTML headings are used to define the titles and subtitles of sections on a webpage. They help organize the content and create a structure that is easy to navigate.

Proper use of headings enhances readability by organizing content into clear sections.
Search engines utilize headings to understand page structure, aiding in SEO.



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" 
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
    <h3>This is a Smaller Subheading</h3>
    <h4>This is a Sub-Subheading</h4>
    <h5>This is a Minor Subheading</h5>
    <h6>This is the Smallest Heading</h6>
</body>
</html>
This code uses HTML heading tags (<h1> to <h6>) to create headings that range from the main heading to the smallest subheading.
Each tag shoes the hierarchy of the content, helping organize the structure of the webpage.
Note: the 'h' inside the tag should always be in lowercase.

Levels of HTML Heading Tags
HTML offers six levels of heading tags, each serving a different purpose in structuring your content:

<h1> – Main Heading (Largest)
Represents the primary focus of the page, usually used for the main title.
Use only one <h1> tag per page for the best SEO practices.
Makes it clear to both users and search engines what the main topic is.
<h2> – Subheadings
Ideal for dividing the content into major sections.
If the content has further subsections, use <h3> to create a logical flow.
<h3> to <h6> – Smaller Headings
These heading levels are used for finer subdivisions, gradually decreasing in size and importance.
<h3> is used for subsections under <h2>, while <h4> to <h6> are used for additional, less important subdivisions.
<h6> defines the least important heading.
Customization in HTML Heading Tags
Customization in HTML heading tags allows you to change their style, color, font, and alignment using CSS.




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" 
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>H1 Heading</h1>
​
    <!-- With the help of Style attribute you can customize
           the size of the heading, As done below-->
​
    <h1 style="font-size: 50px">H1 with new size.</h1>
​
    <!-- Here font-size is the property by which  we can 
           modify the heading. Here we kept it 50px i.e. 50 pixels -->
​
</body>
​
</html>
Best Practices for Using HTML Headings
Use Only One <h1> per Page: The <h1> tag should be reserved for the main title of the page. Too many <h1> tags can confuse both users and search engines about the content’s priority.
Maintain a Logical Structure: Follow a logical hierarchy of headings (<h1> → <h2> → <h3>) to ensure content is organized. Don't jump directly from <h1> to <h4>, as it can make the content harder to navigate.
Keep Headings Descriptive: Headings should clearly describe the content that follows. This makes it easier for readers to understand what each section is about.
Avoid Overusing Heading Tags: Headings are for organizing content, not for styling text. Use them where appropriate and avoid using heading tags for emphasis or styling alone.
