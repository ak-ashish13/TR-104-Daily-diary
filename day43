React Tutorial
Last Updated : 06 Dec, 2025
React is a powerful JavaScript library for building fast, scalable front-end applications. Created by Facebook, it's known for its component-based structure, single-page applications (SPAs), and virtual DOM,enabling efficient UI updates and a seamless user experience.

Note: The latest stable version of React is 19.1.0.

Why Learn React?
Before React, front-end development struggled with:

Manual DOM Manipulation: Traditional JavaScript directly modified the DOM, slowing down the performance.
Complex State Management: Maintaining UI state became messy and hard to debug.
Tight Coupling in Frameworks: Frameworks like Angular introduced complex two-way data binding that made code harder to manage.
React solved these issues with a modern and modular approach.

Core Features
Virtual DOM: React updates only the changed parts of the DOM, resulting in faster rendering.
One-Way Data Binding: Ensures predictable and easy to debug data flow.
Component-Based Architecture: Breaks UI into reusable pieces, improving the code reusability and scalability.
React Tutorial Prerequisites:  HTML, CSS and JavaScript

React Hello World Program
To start with React, you need to install it. Follow the steps below to install it on your system.

How to Install ReactJS on Windows
How to Install ReactJS on MacOS
How to Install ReactJS on Linux
After installing React, let's write your first React program. Here's a simple code example:


import React from 'react';

function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello World</h1>
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
In this example:

import React from 'react': Imports the React library to use React features in the component.
function App() { ... }: Defines a React functional component called App.
return ( ... ): The return statement renders HTML-like code (JSX) inside the component.
<div><h1>Hello World</h1></div>: Displays a div element containing a heading (h1) with the text "Hello World."
export default App: Exports the App component so it can be used in other files.
