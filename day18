CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a stylesheet language used to style and enhance website presentation. CSS is one of the three main components of a webpage, along with HTML and JavaScript.

HTML adds Structure to a web page.
CSS adds the style and makes it visually appealing.
JavaScript adds interactivity and logic to the page.
CSS was released (in 1996), 3 years after HTML (in 1993). The main idea behind its use is that it allows the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (CSS). This makes websites easier to maintain and more flexible.
