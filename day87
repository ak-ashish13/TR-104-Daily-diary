NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases that rely on fixed schemas and tables, NoSQL offers flexible data models and supports horizontal scaling. This makes them well-suited for modern applications that require high performance, scalability, and the ability to manage diverse data types efficiently.

Key Features of NoSQL Databases
Dynamic schema: Allow flexible shaping of data to meet new requirements without the need to migrate or change schemas.
Horizontal scalability: They scale horizontally for adding more nodes into the existing ones and acquire enough storage for even bigger datasets and much higher traffic by distributing the load on multiple servers.
Document-based: Data are presented in flexible, semi-structured formats like JSON/BSON (e.g., MongoDB).
Key-value-based: They possess a simple but fast access pattern (e.g., Redis) by storing data as pairs of keys and values.
Column-based: Data are organized into columns instead of rows (e.g., CASSANDRA).
Distributed and high availability: They are designed to be highly available and to automatically handle node failures and data replication across multiple nodes in a database cluster.
Flexibility: Allow developers to store and retrieve data in a flexible and dynamic manner, with support for multiple data types and changing data structures.
Performance: Perfect for big data and real-time analytics and high volume applications.
Challenges of NoSQL Databases
Lack of standardization:  NoSQL systems can be vastly different from one another, making it even harder to choose the right one for a specific use case.
Lack of ACID compliance: NoSQL databases may not provide consistency, which is a disadvantage for applications that need strict data integrity.
Narrow focus: Great for storage but lack functionalities as transaction management, in which relational databases are great.
Absence of Complex Query Support: They are not designed to handle complex queries, which means that they are not a good fit for applications that require complex data analysis or reporting.
Lack of maturity: Being relatively new, NoSQL may not have the reliability, security and feature set of traditional relational databases.
Management complexity: For large datasets, maintaining a NoSQL database could be quite more complicated than managing a relational database.
Limited GUI Tools: While some NoSQL databases, like MongoDB offer GUI tools like MongoDB Compass, not all NoSQL databases provide flexible or user-friendly GUI tools.
SQL vs. NoSQL:

Use of NoSQL
Big Data Applications: Efficiently stores and processes massive amounts of unstructured and semi-structured data.
Real-Time Analytics: Supports fast queries and analysis for use cases like recommendation engines or fraud detection.
Scalable Web Applications: Handles high traffic and large user bases by scaling horizontally across servers.
Flexible Data Storage: Manages diverse data formats (JSON, key-value, documents, graphs) without rigid schemas.
