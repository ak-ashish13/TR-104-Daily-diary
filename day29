To add JavaScript in HTML document, several methods can be used. These methods include embedding JavaScript directly within the HTML file or linking an external JavaScript file.

Inline JavaScript
You can write JavaScript code directly inside the HTML element using the onclick, onmouseover, or other event handler attributes.




<html>
<head></head>
<body>
    <h2>
        Adding JavaScript in HTML Document
    </h2>
    <button onclick="alert('Button Clicked!')">
        Click Here
    </button>
</body>
</html>
Internal JavaScript (Within <script> Tag)
You can write JavaScript code inside the <script> tag within the HTML file. This is known as internal JavaScript and is commonly placed inside the <head> or <body> section of the HTML document.

1. JavaScript Code Inside <head> Tag
Placing JavaScript within the <head> section of an HTML document ensures that the script is loaded and executed as the page loads. This is useful for scripts that need to be initialized before the page content is rendered.




<html>
<head>
    <script>
        function myFun() {
            document.getElementById("demo")
                .innerHTML = "Content changed!";
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>
        Add JavaScript Code
        inside Head Section
    </h2>
    <h3 id="demo" style="color:green;">
        GeeksforGeeks
    </h3>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFun()">
        Click Here
    </button>
</body>
</html>
2. JavaScript Code Inside <body> Tag
JavaScript can also be placed inside the <body> section of an HTML page. Typically, scripts placed at the end of the <body> load after the content, which can be useful if your script depends on the DOM being fully loaded.




<html>
<head></head>
<body>
    <h2>
        Add JavaScript Code
        inside Body Section
    </h2>
    <h3 id="demo" style="color:green;">
        GeeksforGeeks
    </h3>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFun()">
        Click Here
    </button>
    <script>
        function myFun() {
            document.getElementById("demo")
                .innerHTML = "Content changed!";
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
External JavaScript (Using External File)
For larger projects or when reusing scripts across multiple HTML files, you can place your JavaScript code in an external .js file. This file is then linked to your HTML document using the src attribute within a <script> tag.


<html>
<head>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>
        External JavaScript
    </h2>
    <h3 id="demo" style="color:green;">
        GeeksforGeeks
    </h3>
    <button type="button" onclick="myFun()">
        Click Here
    </button>
</body>
</html>

Advantages of External JavaScript
Faster Page Load Times: Cached external JavaScript files don’t need to be reloaded every time the page is visited, which can speed up loading times.
Improved Readability and Maintenance: Keeping HTML and JavaScript separate makes both easier to read and maintain.
Separation of Concerns: By separating HTML (structure) and JavaScript (behavior), your code becomes cleaner and more modular.
Code Reusability: One external JavaScript file can be linked to multiple HTML files, reducing redundancy and making updates easier.
Asynchronous and Deferred JavaScript
JavaScript can be loaded asynchronously or deferred to optimize page performance, especially for larger scripts. By default, JavaScript blocks the rendering of the HTML page until it is fully loaded, but using async or defer can help improve load times.

1. async Attribute
The async attribute loads the script asynchronously, meaning the script will be downloaded and executed as soon as it is available, without blocking the page.

<script src="script.js" async></script>
2. defer Attribute
The defer attribute delays the execution of the script until the entire HTML document has been parsed. This is particularly useful for scripts that manipulate the DOM.

<script src="script.js" defer></script>

How to Reference External JavaScript Files?
We can reference an external script in three ways in javascript:

By using a full URL:
src = "https://www.geeksforgeek.org/js/script.js"
By using a file path:
src = "/js/script.js"
Without using any path:
src = "script.js"
