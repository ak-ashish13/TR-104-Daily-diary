In ReactJS PropTypes are the property that is mainly shared between the parent components to the child components. It is used to solve the type validation problem.

Type Safety: When the wrong data type is passed in the component, PropTypes help find the issues.
Better Debugging: During development, they give warning messages in the console, which makes it easier to find the bugs.
Improved Documentation: It acts as self-documentation for your components, showing the expected types of props.
Prevents Runtime Errors: We can avoid errors caused by unexpected data types during the execution of the application, by enforcing prop types.
Note: In the latest version of the react 19 the proptypes has been removed. It was deprecated in react version 15.5.

How to Use PropTypes in React?
Below are the steps to use PropTypes in React:

Step 1: Install the prop-types Package
npx create-react-app react-app
cd react-app
npm install prop-types
Project Structure
Output

//src/components/Button.js

import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const Button = ({ label, type }) => {
    return <button className={`btn btn-${type}`}>{label}</button>;
};

Button.propTypes = {
    label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    type: PropTypes.oneOf(['primary', 'secondary', 'danger']).isRequired,
};

export default Button;

ReactJS PropTypes
In this example

three reusable components are there Greeting, Button, and UserProfile, each with PropTypes validation to implement correct prop types and default values.
Greeting displays a personalized message and age (default age: 25 if not provided).
Button enforces type as one of ['primary', 'secondary', 'danger'].
UserProfile expects a user object with name, age, and email.
The App component renders Greeting, Button, and UserProfile, passing props like name, age, label, type, and user object.
The index.js file initializes the React app using ReactDOM.createRoot() and renders the App component inside <React.StrictMode>, ensuring best practices and error handling.
Common PropTypes Validators
Here's a list of common PropTypes validators:

PropType	Description
PropTypes.string	Confirms the prop is a string.
PropTypes.number	Confirms the prop is a number.
PropTypes.bool	Confirms the prop is a boolean (true or false).
PropTypes.func	Confirms the prop is a function.
PropTypes.array	Confirms the prop is an array.
PropTypes.object	Confirms the prop is an object.
PropTypes.node	Confirms the prop can be anything that can be rendered (e.g., numbers, strings, elements, or an array of elements).
PropTypes.element	Confirms the prop is a React element.
PropTypes.instanceOf(Class)	Confirms the prop is an instance of a particular class.
PropTypes.oneOf([value1, value2])	Confirms the prop matches one of the provided values.
PropTypes.oneOfType([type1, type2])	Confirms the prop matches one of the provided types.
PropTypes.arrayOf(type)	Confirms the prop is an array of a specific type.
PropTypes.objectOf(type)	Confirms the prop is an object where all values are of a specific type.
PropTypes.shape({})	Confirms the prop is an object with a specific shape.
Advanced PropTypes Usage
Below are some of the advanced PropTypes usage:

Default Props
By using the defaultProps we can also specify the default values for props. This is used when certain props are optional and we want to set a default value in case they are not passed.

Greeting.defaultProps = {
    name: 'Guest',
    age: 18,
};
With this, if no name or age is provided, the component will use 'Guest' and 18 as default values.

PropTypes with Arrays and Objects
Array of specific types:

Component.propTypes = {
    items: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.string),
};
Object with specific shape:

Component.propTypes = {
    user: PropTypes.shape({
        id: PropTypes.number.isRequired,
        name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    }),
};
PropTypes with Custom Validation
Component.propTypes = {
    age: (props, propName, componentName) => {
        if (props[propName] < 18) {
            return new Error(`${componentName}: ${propName} should be at least 18.`);
        }
    },
};
PropTypes with Enum (One of Specific Values)
We can use oneOf from setting the proper to set of predefined values.

Button.propTypes = {
    type: PropTypes.oneOf(['primary', 'secondary', 'danger']),
};
PropTypes with One of Multiple Types
Component.propTypes = {
    value: PropTypes.oneOfType([
        PropTypes.string,
        PropTypes.number,
    ]),
};
