The CSS syntax defines how CSS rules are written so that browsers can interpret and apply them to HTML elements.

Selector: Targets the HTML element "h1" to apply styles.
Declaration Block: Enclosed in curly braces { }, contains one or more declarations.
Property: Specifies the style attribute, here "color" for text color.
Value: Defines the property's setting, here "blue" for the text hue.
Overall Structure: Forms a complete CSS rule: h1 { color: blue; }, styling h1 headings blue.



<html>
<head>
    <style>
        /* CSS Rule */
        h1 {
            color: blue;
            /* Property: value */
            font-size: 24px;
        }
​
        p {
            color: green;
            font-size: 16px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
​
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a simple paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
In above Example,

h1: This selector targets all <h1> elements on the page. The style applied to <h1> will set the text color to blue and the font size to 24px.
p: This selector targets all <p> elements. The text color will be green and the font size will be 16px.
Selectors in CSS
Selectors define which HTML elements are styled. CSS offers several types of selectors.

1. Universal Selector: Applies styles to all elements.


* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
} 
2. Type Selector: Targets specific HTML elements.


h1 {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
3. Class Selector: Styles elements with a specific class attribute.


.box {
    border: 1px solid black;
    padding: 10px;
}
4. ID Selector: Targets a single element with a specific ID.


#header {
    background-color: lightgray;
}
Declaration Block in CSS Syntax
Each declaration consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon, and each declaration is followed by a semicolon:

1. Properties: Properties are the aspects of the selected elements you want to style (like color, width, height, etc.).

color: Defines the text color.
background-color: Defines the background color of an element.
font-size: Sets the size of the font.
margin: Specifies the space around an element.
padding: Defines the space between the element's content and its border.
2. Values: Values define the specifics of the property you want to apply, such as a color name, a number (e.g., 16px), or percentages (e.g., 50%).

Grouping and Nesting of CSS Selectors
You can group selectors to apply the same styles or nest them for hierarchical targeting.

1. Grouping

h1, h2, h3 {
    color: darkblue;
}
2. Nesting

ul li {
    list-style-type: square;
}
Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements
Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are used for styling specific states or parts of elements. Pseudo classes target's the elements based on a particular state and pseudo elements targets the elements on basis of a particular part of that element.

a:hover {
    color: green;
}
​
/*pseudo-element selector*/
p::first-line {
    font-weight: bold;
}
