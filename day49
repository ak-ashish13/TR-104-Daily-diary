ReactJS Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM (Document Object Model). React uses this lightweight JavaScript object to track changes in the application state and efficiently update the actual DOM only where necessary.

How Does the Virtual DOM Work?
Here's a breakdown of how the Virtual DOM works:

Rendering the Virtual DOM: React creates a virtual representation of the UI as a tree of JavaScript objects.
Updating State: It generates a new virtual DOM tree to reflect the updated state when the application state changes.
Diffing Algorithm: React compares the new Virtual DOM tree with the previous one using its efficient diffing algorithm to identify the minimal set of changes required.
Updating the Real DOM: React applies only the necessary changes to the real DOM, optimizing rendering performance.

What is React Fiber?
React Fiber is like an upgraded engine for React, making it run smoother and faster. Before Fiber, React would do all its updates at once, which could sometimes make your app feel slow or "choppy." Fiber breaks down this work into smaller, manageable pieces, allowing React to pause and resume tasks as needed. This means important things like your clicks or animations get immediate attention, making your app feel much more responsive and fluid.

Key Features of React’s Virtual DOM
Efficient Updates: By minimizing direct interactions with the real DOM, React significantly reduces rendering time.
Reconciliation Process: React’s reconciliation efficiently updates the UI based on changes in the Virtual DOM.
Batching Updates: Multiple state updates are batched into a single re-render cycle, avoiding unnecessary computations.
Cross-Browser Consistency: The Virtual DOM standardizes behaviour across different browsers, ensuring consistent rendering.
Component-Based Architecture: Virtual DOM integrates seamlessly with React’s component-based architecture, promoting modular and reusable code.
How React’s Virtual DOM Improves Performance
Avoids Full DOM Repaints: React calculates and applies only the changes needed instead of repainting the entire DOM.
Optimized Rendering: Updates to the Virtual DOM are synchronized with browser rendering cycles, avoiding redundant operations.
Reduces JavaScript Execution Time: Lightweight Virtual DOM trees are faster to manipulate than the actual DOM.
Intelligent Rendering Decisions: React intelligently avoids rendering components that haven’t changed using techniques like memoization.
Why React is so Fast?
React's speed comes from its efficient Virtual DOM. Instead of directly manipulating the slow Real DOM, React updates an in-memory copy. It then uses a smart algorithm to figure out only the necessary changes and applies them in a highly optimized way. This, combined with the Fiber architecture's ability to prioritize and break down rendering tasks, ensures the UI remains responsive and smooth even during complex updates.

Frameworks and Libraries Using Virtual DOM
ReactJS: The pioneer in using the Virtual DOM for efficient UI rendering.
Vue.js: Employs a Virtual DOM to provide reactive and declarative UI development.
Inferno: A fast and lightweight React alternative that uses the Virtual DOM.
Preact: A minimalistic version of React with a Virtual DOM for high performance.

Is the shadow DOM same as Virtual DOM?
No, they are different. Virtual DOM is a performance optimization used by JavaScript frameworks like React to efficiently update the browser's main DOM by comparing virtual copies. Shadow DOM, on the other hand, is a native web standard for encapsulating a component's internal structure, styles, and behavior, creating isolated DOM subtrees for building reusable web components.

Real Life Use Cases of Virtual DOM
frame_3


Real-life usage of the Virtual DOM in several high-performance web applications like Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Twitter Lite, WhatsApp Web, and Airbnb. These platforms handle large-scale, dynamic content and rely on the Virtual DOM to efficiently manage UI updates.

By using a Virtual DOM, changes are first calculated in memory and only the differences are applied to the real DOM, making rendering faster and more optimized. This approach minimizes reflows and repaints in the browser, leading to better performance and smoother user interactions.

Note: It is especially beneficial for single-page applications (SPAs) where responsiveness and speed are critical.

Real DOM vs Virtual DOM vs Shadow DOM
Feature

Real DOM

Virtual DOM

Shadow DOM

What is it?

The actual structure of a web page, a tree-like representation of HTML.

A lightweight, in-memory representation of the Real DOM.

A web standard for encapsulating a subtree of DOM elements within a component

Purpose

Represents the UI, allowing programs to access and modify content.

Optimizes performance by minimizing direct Real DOM manipulations.

Encapsulation of component's internal structure, styles, and behavior.

Manipulation

Directly manipulates on-screen elements.

Does not directly manipulate on-screen elements; it's a diffing mechanism.

Creates an isolated DOM subtree that doesn't affect the main DOM.

performance

Can be slow for frequent updates as it re-renders the entire tree.

Fast updates due to diffing algorithm and batching of changes.

Can enhance performance by isolating styles and behavior, reducing conflicts.

Encapsulation

No inherent encapsulation; styles and scripts are global

No inherent encapsulation; focuses on update efficiency.

Provides strong encapsulation for styles and JavaScript within a component.

Implementation

Native to web browsers.

Implemented by JavaScript libraries/frameworks (e.g., React, Vue).

Native web standard implemented by browsers.

Use Case

Fundamental for all web pages.

Used in modern JavaScript frameworks for efficient UI updates.

Building reusable, self-contained web components with scoped styles.

Direct UI Update

Yes, direct changes are immediately visible.

No, updates are first applied to the virtual copy, then "patched" to the Real DOM.

No, it's an isolated part of the DOM, not the primary UI update mechanism.

CSS Scoping

Global CSS, prone to conflicts.

Global CSS (unless handled by frameworks).

Scoped CSS, styles defined within a Shadow DOM stay within it.

comparison
Virtual DOM is best for performance and update speed.
Shadow DOM is ideal for encapsulation and managing complex UI components.
Real DOM is less efficient and not preferred for dynamic or modern web applications
