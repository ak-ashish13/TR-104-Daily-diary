HTML DOCTYPE (Document Type Declaration) is an instruction that appears at the beginning of an HTML document, before the <html> tag.

Its primary role is to tell the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in, ensuring that the browser renders the content correctly.
It is not an HTML tag, but rather a special instruction that specifies how the browser should interpret the HTML.
It is recommended to always use <!DOCTYPE html> at the top of your HTML file for HTML5.
For HTML5, the declaration looks like this:
< !DOCTYPE html >
Note: The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is NOT case-sensitive.

How HTML Doctype tell the browser which version of html it is?
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration doesn’t directly specify which version of HTML is being used (like, "HTML5" or "HTML4"), but rather it tells the browser to use a specific rendering mode. It helps the browser determine how it should interpret the content.

There are two main modes:

Standards Mode: The browser will render the page according to the modern web standards.
Quirks Mode: The browser will render the page in a backwards-compatible manner, emulating older web behavior to handle legacy content.
Example of Using DOCTYPE in HTML5
Here, for example, we declare <!DOCTYPE html>, which triggers standard mode and tells the browser to use HTML5 specifications.




<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
    <p>welcome to my website</p>
</body>
</html>
What Happens Without <!DOCTYPE html>
Without <!DOCTYPE html>, your HTML code can still run, but it may face several significant drawbacks:

Quirks Mode Activation: Browsers may switch to quirks mode, leading to outdated behaviors that cause inconsistent rendering compared to standards mode.
Rendering Issues: CSS properties like box-sizing, margins, and widths may be interpreted differently, causing layout problems and misaligned elements that are difficult to debug.
Cross-Browser Inconsistencies: Different browsers might render the page differently in quirks mode, making it hard to achieve cross-browser consistency.
CSS and JavaScript Problems: Modern features like Flexbox, Grid, and certain JavaScript methods may not work correctly, causing compatibility issues.
Unpredictable Behavior: Without <!DOCTYPE>, rendering becomes unpredictable, making debugging more challenging and leading to unpredictable page behavior when adding new features.

Best Practices When Using DOCTYPE
Always Declare DOCTYPE: Always start an HTML document with a DOCTYPE declaration to ensure that the browser knows how to correctly render the page.
Use HTML5 DOCTYPE for New Websites: For all new projects, use the HTML5 DOCTYPE as it is the most current and widely supported standard.
Validate Your HTML: Use the W3C validation service to check if your HTML document adheres to the standards specified by the DOCTYPE.
