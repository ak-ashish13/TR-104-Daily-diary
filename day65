In NodeJS, you can change the console font color to improve readability and enhance user experience, especially for debugging or logging purposes. Although NodeJS does not provide built-in methods for modifying font colors, developers can achieve this using ANSI escape codes or external libraries like chalk and colors.

1. Using ANSI Escape Codes (No External Library)
You can change the font color in NodeJS by using ANSI escape codes, which are sequences of characters that control text formatting, including colors. This method doesn't require any external libraries.

Steps to Use ANSI Escape Codes:

Define the ANSI escape codes for different colors.
Use these codes in your console.log statements.
Now, let's understand with the help of an example


// ANSI escape codes for text color
const red = '\x1b[31m';
const green = '\x1b[32m';
const reset = '\x1b[0m';

// Use the escape codes to change font color
console.log(red + 'This text is red.' + reset);
console.log(green + 'This text is green.' + reset);
Output

Change NodeJS console Font Color - Using ANSI Escape Codes
In this example

\x1b[31m sets the text color to red.
\x1b[32m sets the text color to green.
\x1b[0m resets the color back to the default.
Common ANSI Escape Codes for Colors
\x1b[31m: Red
\x1b[32m: Green
\x1b[33m: Yellow
\x1b[34m: Blue
\x1b[35m: Magenta
\x1b[36m: Cyan
\x1b[37m: White
This method allows you to manually format text, but keep in mind that some terminals might not support or have disabled ANSI escape codes by default. If you encounter issues, consider using third-party libraries like chalk for cross-platform color formatting in the console.

2. Using chalk Library
chalk is a popular and flexible NodeJS library that allows you to style strings in the console. It provides a range of colors and styles to format your console output.

Steps to Use chalk
Step 1: Install chalk via npm

npm install chalk
Step 2: import the chalk library

import chalk from 'chalk';
Now, let us understand with the help of the example


import chalk from 'chalk';

console.log(chalk.green('Success: Everything is working fine!'));
console.log(chalk.yellow('Warning: Please check your input.'));
console.log(chalk.red('Error: Something went wrong.'));
Output

Change NodeJS console Font Color - Chalk Library
In this example

import chalk from 'chalk' imports the chalk library, which allows you to style and color text in the terminal.
chalk.green(), chalk.yellow(), and chalk.red() are used to change the text color to green, yellow, and red respectively.
Applications of Changing Console Font Color
Error Handling: You can display errors in red to make them stand out.
Debugging Logs: Useful for distinguishing between different log levels (info, warn, error).
User Interfaces: Enhance console-based user interfaces with colorful outputs for better user interaction.
