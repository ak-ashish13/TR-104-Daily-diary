React-Redux is a popular state management library that helps manage the application state in React applications. It helps manage an application's state in a centralized way, making it easier to maintain and debug, especially as the app grows in complexity.

It is based on three fundamental principles:

Single Source of Truth: The entire application state is stored in a single JavaScript object called the store.
State is Read-Only: The only way to change the state is by dispatching an action that describes the change.
Changes are Made with Pure Functions: Changes to the state are made using reducers, which are pure functions that take the previous state and an action, and return the new state.
Core Concepts of React-Redux
To effectively use React-Redux, you need to understand some key concepts:

1. Store
The store is a centralized object that holds the application state. It is the only place where the state can be modified.

2. Actions
An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes a change in the application state. It must have a type property and can optionally include a payload.

const incrementAction = {
    type: 'INCREMENT',
    payload: 1
};
3. Reducers
A reducer is a pure function that specifies how the application’s state changes in response to an action. It takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state.

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT':
            return state + action.payload;
        case 'DECREMENT':
            return state - action.payload;
        default:
            return state;
    }
};
4. Dispatch
The dispatch function is used to send an action to the Redux store, triggering the reducer to process the state change.

store.dispatch(incrementAction);
5. Selectors
A selector is a function that retrieves specific pieces of state from the Redux store. It helps to abstract the state retrieval process, making it easier to access state in a more manageable way.

const selectCount = (state) => state.count;
6. Provider
The Provider component makes the Redux store available to all the components in the application. It should wrap the entire application so that any component can access the store.

import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

<Provider store={store}>
    <App />
</Provider>;
7. connect()
connect() is a function provided by React-Redux to connect React components to the Redux store. It allows the components to access the state and dispatch actions.

import { connect } from 'react-redux';

const Counter = ({ count, increment }) => (
    <div>
        <h1>{count}</h1>
        <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
);

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    count: state.count
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 })
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
React-Redux Working
React-Redux connects React components to the Redux store, ensuring smooth state management across your app. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it works:

1. Setting Up the Store
The Redux store holds the entire state of your application. It’s created using createStore() and initialized with a reducer to define how the state changes.

const store = createStore(counterReducer);
2. Dispatching Actions
Actions are plain objects that describe changes in state. These actions are dispatched to inform Redux of a state change.

store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 });
3. Reducers Update the State
A reducer is a function that updates the state based on the action type. It takes the current state and action, then returns a new state.

const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'INCREMENT': return state + action.payload;
        default: return state;
    }
};
4. Connecting Components with connect()
React-Redux’s connect() function connects React components to the Redux store, allowing components to access state and dispatch actions.

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({ count: state });
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    increment: () => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT', payload: 1 })
});
5. Using Provider to Make Store Accessible
The Provider component makes the store available to all components in the app.

<Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>
6. Re-Renders and Reactivity
React-Redux ensures that only components dependent on updated state will re-render, optimizing performance.

Steps To Implement React-Redux
Step 1: Setting Up the Project
First, create a new React app using create-react-app:

npx create-react-app react-redux-countercd react-redux-counter
Next, install redux and react-redux:

npm install redux react-redux

"dependencies": {
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.17.0",
    "@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
    "@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
    "react": "^18.3.1",

    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "redux": "^5.0.1",
    "web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
}
Step 2: Define Action Types
You need to define action types, which represent the actions that will update the state.


// src/redux/actionTypes.js
export const INCREMENT = 'INCREMENT';
export const DECREMENT = 'DECREMENT';
Step 3: Action Creators
Action creators are functions that return action objects.


// src/redux/actions.js
import { INCREMENT, DECREMENT } from "./actionTypes";

export const increment = () => ({
    type: INCREMENT,
});

export const decrement = () => ({
    type: DECREMENT,
});
Step 4: Reducers
Reducers specify how the application's state changes in response to actions. The reducer function receives the current state and action, and returns the updated state.


// src/redux/reducer.js
import { INCREMENT, DECREMENT } from "./actionTypes";

const initialState = {
    count: 0,
};

const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case INCREMENT:
            return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
        case DECREMENT:
            return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
        default:
            return state;
    }
};

export default counterReducer;
Step 5: Create the Redux Store
Now, create the Redux store using the createStore function from Redux.
