Control flow statements in JavaScript control the order in which code is executed. These statements allow you to make decisions, repeat tasks, and jump between parts of a program based on specific conditions.

JavaScript if Statement
The if statement executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

Loading Playground...
const age = 18;
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("You are an adult.");
}

Output
You are an adult.
Checks if age is greater than or equal to 18.
Logs "You are an adult." if the condition is true.
JavaScript if...else Statement
The if...else statement provides an alternate block of code to execute if the condition is false.

Loading Playground...
const score = 40;
if (score >= 50) {
    console.log("You passed.");
} else {
    console.log("You failed.");
}

Output
You failed.
It will log "You passed." if the score is 50 or more.
Otherwise, logs "You failed."
JavaScript if...else if...else Statement
The if...else if...else statement is used when you want to handle multiple conditions.

const temp = 25;
if (temp > 30) {
    console.log("It's hot.");
} else if (temp >= 20) {
    console.log("It's warm.");
} else {
    console.log("It's cold.");
}

Output
It's warm.
Checks if the temperature is greater than 30, logs "It's hot."
If not, checks if it's between 20 and 30, logs "It's warm."
Otherwise, logs "It's cold."
JavaScript switch Statement
The switch statement evaluates an expression and executes a block of code based on matching cases. It provides an alternative to long if-else chain.

const day = "Monday";
switch (day) {
    case "Monday":
        console.log("Start of the week.");
        break;
    case "Friday":
        console.log("End of the workweek.");
        break;
    default:
        console.log("It's a regular day.");
}

Output
Start of the week.
Checks the value of day and matches it to a case.
Logs "Start of the week." if day is "Monday".
Logs "End of the workweek." if day is "Friday".
Logs "It's a regular day." if no cases match.
JavaScript Ternary Operator or Conditional Operator:
In some programming languages, a ternary operator is used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition.

Loading Playground...
let a = 10;
console.log(a === 5 ? "a is equal to 5" : "a is not equal to 5");
Output

a is not equal to 5
Variable Declaration: let a = 10; assigns 10 to variable a.
Ternary Operator: a === 5 ? "a is equal to 5" : "a is not equal to 5"; checks if a is strictly equal to 5.
If true, it returns "a is equal to 5".
If false, it returns "a is not equal to 5".
Uses of Control Flow Statements
Control flow statements are backbone in programming for

Decision-Making: To execute specific blocks of code based on conditions (e.g., if, if...else).
Branching: To exit loops or skip iterations (break, continue).
Looping: To repeat tasks (for, while, do...while).
Switching: To handle multiple conditions effectively (switch).
